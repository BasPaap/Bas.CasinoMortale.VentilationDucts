## How to use
Control the robot with the arrow keys.

### Editing the map
Press E to open the map editor. Types of tiles can be selected on the toolbar at the top. Click on any cell in the grid to place the currently selected tile or to clear the cell if the clear tool is selected. Use the mouse wheel to rotate the tile in 90 degree increments before placing it.

When selecting a sound tile, select the audio files that should be played from the dialog. These will be played sequentially: if you return to the audio tile after having heard the first sound, the second sound will play, etc. New sounds can be added by copying MP3's to the StreamingAssets folder. 

Press E again to close the editor.

### Resetting the map
Press X to reset the map to the default version.
